# New Zealand transport data and APIs

A place to record the location of transport data in New Zealand, from any source. "Transport data" can include:

- Road network datasets
- Automated or manual counts of vehicles, pedestrians, etc.
- GTFS or other records of public Transport
- Alert APIs
- Real-time traffic or PT location APIs
- Static datasets (maybe old extracts of historical data)
- Accident locations
- Statistics on driver licensing
- Journey planners
- Resource consents (e.g. minimum parking policies)

... and many more!

Pull requests encouraged, this is nowhere near complete!

Want a dataset but don't know where to look or if it even exists? File an issue to alert others and perhaps someone else will know and add it to the list.

If you notice a dead link, an issue will be good for that, too. Otherwise, contact me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alphabeta_soup).
